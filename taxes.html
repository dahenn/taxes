            <h1> Donald Trump is planning to change the tax code in some pretty significant ways.
            It's worth understanding how it will affect different taxpayers.</h1>

            <h2>What's the use of federal income taxes?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class='text col-lg-9 col-sm-12'>
            <p>Individual income taxes collected by the federal government are an incredibly important source of government revenue.
                In fact, individual income taxes represent <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-where-do-federal-tax-revenues-come-from" target="_blank">
                about half of all federal revenue</a>.</p>
            <p>On the other side of the equation, federal expenditures are fairly straightforward.
                <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/policy-basics-where-do-our-federal-tax-dollars-go?fa=view&id=1258" target="_blank">About 2/3</a> is spent on defense, social security, and federal healthcare programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP.
                Another 16% is spent on safety net programs and paying interest on debt.</p>
            <p>All this is to say that <b>individual income taxes represent a significant portion of federal tax income</b>, and that a large portion of federal spending is <b>spoken for by vital non-discretionary programs</b>.
                Therefore, any significant decrease in income tax receipts will have to be balanced by decreases in federal spending, otherwise deficit spending will increase significantly.</p>

            <h2>What are Trump's proposed changes?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class='text col-lg-9 col-sm-12'>
            <p><b>Tax law is complicated.</b> That being said, the changes proposed by Trump can be broken down into a few categories:</p>
            <h4>Fewer brackets, lower rates:</h4>
            <p>Currently, there are 7 tax brackets, with marginal tax rates ranging from 10% up to 39.6%.
                Trump's plan will have 3 tax brackets, with rates of 12%, 25%, and 33%.
                The most consequential change here is the change in the top margin from 39.6% to 33%, which is partnered with a decrease in the
                threshold from over $400,000 to $112,500 for individuals or $225,000 for joint filers.</p>
            <h4>Larger deductions:</h4>
            <p>While Trump's lowest marginal rate than currently, his plan also has significantly more generous standard deductions. A standard deduction
                is the amount that you can automatically deduct from your taxable income if you do not want to itemize deductions. Trump's standard deductions are about twice as large as currently.</p>
            <p>Trump will also be introducing a selection of additional deductions for childcare costs, which are aimed to offset his elimination of personal exemptions.</p>

        <div class='text col-lg-9 col-sm-12'>
            <p>This analysis highlights a broader theme of Trump's tax plans: large reductions in federal tax revenues without planned cuts in expenditures.
                This means there will be significant increases in defecit spending - the most conservative estimate would be $2.6 trillion over a ten year period. The highest estimate is nearly $6 trillion.</p>
            <p>You can read the <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-tax-reform-plan-september-2016" target="_blank">complete analysis</a> done by the Tax Foundation.</p>
            <p>The unfunded tax cuts, if implemented, would have to be paid for somehow. I think we already know how that may take form given policy proposals from top Republicans and lessons from history -
                major cuts to entitlement programs and other government programs. Remember - the vast majority of the Federal budget is already spoken for with important social programs and other non-discretionary programs.
                President Trump has promised not to cut social security or Medicare, and has promised expanded and more effective coverage than Obamacare. He wants to have his cake and eat it too. Does this really seem possible?</p>

            <h4>What were my simplifying assumptions?</h4>
            <p>Since tax law is so complex, I made some simplifying assumptions to make reaching some conclusions possible.
                These assumptions were conservative; that is, they likely understated the redistributive effects of Trump's plan.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Everyone takes the standard deductions and normal personal exemptions.</li>
                <li>Trump's proposed childcare deductions are not present.</li>
                <li>Only single and married filers were examined (there are additional filing statuses under current law).</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>How did I make my calculations?</h4>
            <p>Calculations of tax amounts due were based on different formulas for each plan. The tax brackets were gathered from
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States#Federal_income_tax_rates_for_individuals" target="_blank">current law</a> and <a href="http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-tax-reform-plan-september-2016" target="_blank">Trump's proposed plan</a>.</p>
            <p>Data on the current income distribution in the United States was gathered from the March 2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_Population_Survey" target="_blank">Current Population Survey (CPS)</a>, which is produced by the US Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
                This data was accessed via the <a href="https://cps.ipums.org/cps/" target="_blank">University of Minnesota's IPUMS-CPS project</a>.</p>
            <p>This CPS sampled 69,458 households, from which I extrapolated a national income distribution. Total taxation changes were also extrapolated based on this sample to the roughly <a href="https://www.census.gov/hhes/families/files/hh1.csv" target="_blank">125 million total households</a> in the US.</p>
            <p>My assumption of 60% married filers versus 40% single filers is based on US census data on <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/families/data/cps2016H.html" target="_blank">Households by Type</a>.</p>
